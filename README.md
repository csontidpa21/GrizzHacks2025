Secure Hardware Sentinel (SHS) is an integrated cybersecurity hardware toolkit designed to detect, analyze, and prevent wireless attacks (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RFID, NFC) in real-time. SHS operates as a portable hardware-based solution combining a Raspberry Pi (or ESP32) with specialized hardware modules to continuously monitor wireless communications. Leveraging AI-based anomaly detection algorithms, SHS identifies potential threats such as rogue access points, unauthorized Bluetooth pairing attempts, or malicious RFID/NFC skimming. A user-friendly dashboard offers real-time threat visualization, actionable alerts, and remediation advice through an integrated GPT-powered assistant.
